# External Resources and Privacy – Scrubber

**Last updated:** December 18, 2025

---

## Purpose of This Document
This document explains which external resources Scrubber uses, what each URL does, and how these operations comply with GDPR principles. The goal is to reassure users that privacy and security are fully respected.

---

## Key Privacy Principle
**Your documents never leave your device.** All metadata removal happens locally in your browser. No file contents, metadata, or derived data are uploaded, stored remotely, or shared with any third party.

---

## External Resources Overview
Scrubber uses minimal external resources for functionality only:

### 1. JSZip Library
- **Purpose**: Required to open, modify, and repackage ZIP-based document formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx, .odt, .ods, .odp).
- **Primary URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rSignal86/Scrubber/main/data/jszip.min.js`
- **Fallback URL**: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jszip/3.10.1/jszip.min.js`

**What happens?**
- The browser downloads a static JavaScript file containing the JSZip library.
- No document data or user information is included in this request.
- GitHub and Cloudflare may log standard technical details (IP, timestamp, requested URL) for security and performance. These logs are governed by their GDPR-compliant privacy policies.

### 2. Version Check
- **Purpose**: Checks for the latest release of Scrubber to inform users about updates.
- **URL**: `https://api.github.com/repos/rSignal86/Scrubber/releases/latest`

**What happens?**
- The browser requests the latest release tag from GitHub.
- No user or document data is sent.
- GitHub may log minimal technical details for rate-limiting and security.

### 3. PURL References in Documents
- **Purpose**: Namespaces for metadata standards (e.g., Dublin Core).
- **Examples**:
  ```xml
  xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
  xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/"
  ```
- These are static references inside your document XML. **No network requests** are made to purl.org.

---

## GDPR Compliance
Scrubber aligns with GDPR principles:
- **Privacy by Design and Default** (Art. 25): All processing is local.
- **Data Minimization** (Art. 5): Only selected metadata fields are removed.
- **Integrity and Confidentiality** (Art. 5): No external transfer of document data.

### Roles
- **You (the user)**: Data Controller.
- **Scrubber**: Not a Data Processor (no data is processed externally).
- **GitHub/Cloudflare**: Independent controllers for static resource delivery.

**No Data Processing Agreement is required.**

## Recommendations for Maximum Privacy
- Host JSZip locally instead of using CDN.
- Disable version check by editing the open-source code.
- Use HTTPS and updated browsers.

---

## Why This Matters
These external requests are limited, transparent, and involve only static resources. No sensitive data is ever transmitted. Scrubber offers an extremely low privacy risk profile compared to any server-based solution.

---

**Summary**: Scrubber is safe, GDPR-compliant, and privacy-focused. Your documents stay on your device.
