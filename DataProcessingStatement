**Last updated:** December 18, 2025

## 1. Purpose
This agreement governs the use of **Scrubber**, a client-side tool for removing metadata from documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx, .odt, .ods, .odp). The purpose is to ensure anonymization and privacy by stripping identifying metadata before further processing.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities
- **The User/Organization** acts as the **Data Controller** and has full control over the use of the tool.
- **The Developer of Scrubber** is **not a Data Processor**, as no personal data is transferred or processed externally. All processing occurs locally in the user's browser.

## 3. Data Processing
- No document content, metadata, or personal data is sent to external servers.
- No storage occurs outside the user's device. Files are processed only in temporary memory and are automatically cleared when the page is closed.

---

## 4. External Resources
- The tool uses **JSZip** to handle ZIP-based document formats. This library may be loaded from a CDN or hosted locally.
- No external lookups are performed against PURL URLs in documents; these are static namespace references only.
